**CREATE PRD**

```sh
create PRD document then save into ./documentation/PRD.md
i want to use this PRD as a steps that i will follow on vibe coding, make sure the document is concise and easy to read

the application is structured as a mono repo with clear separation of concerns
the application is using clean code and solid principles
the application is a web application
the application has a responsive design using Bootstrap
the application is using express js for the backend
the application is using SQLite for the database
the application has a basic login page using email and password, using JWT for authentication
the application has a basic register page with field, email, username, birth date, gender and password as inputs
the application has basic error handling and validation for user inputs
the application has a home page that can be accessed after logged in that shows a full calendar of the current month:

- each day can have multiple diary entries
- diary entries can be added, edited, or deleted
- diary entry is simple text with title, tags, and content using a WYSIWYG editor
the project has migration files for the SQLite database
```

**UPDATE THE PRD**

update @documentation/PRD.md:
express js SSR with ejs templating
use common ssr structure instead of mono-repo structure
```

```sh

separate feature implementation incrementaly
```

**IMPLEMENT PHASE 1**

based on @documentation/PRD.md implement Phase 1
```

**IMPLEMENT PHASE 2**

```

**IMPLEMENT PHASE 4**
```sh
based on @documentation/PRD.md implement Phase 4
```

**IMPLEMENT PHASE 5**
```sh
based on @documentation/PRD.md implement Phase 5
```

**ASK FOR UI/UX IMPROVEMENT PLAN**
```sh
make a plan for improving ui/ux on dashboard pages
save the plan into documentation directory
```

**ASK FOR UNIT TESTING PLAN**
```sh
make a plan for unit testing
save the plan into documentation directory
```

**IMPLEMENT UNIT TESTING**
```sh
based on @documentation/unit-testing-plan.md
implement unit testing plan phase 1
```
Terjadi error saat menjalankan npm start
```sh
do not code, find the reason that causing this error when execute npm start. here is the error:
Cannot log after tests are done. Did you forget to wait for something async in your test?
    Attempted to log "Database connection closed".

      30 |           console.error('Error closing database:', err.message);
      31 |         } else {
    > 32 |           console.log('Database connection closed');
         |                   ^
      33 |         }
      34 |       });
      35 |     }

      at Database.log (config/database.js:32:19)
      at Database.replacement (node_modules/sqlite3/lib/trace.js:25:27)
```

```sh
execute Option 2: Make Database Close Synchronous in Tests is the best option.
```

```sh
based on @documentation/unit-testing-plan.md
implement unit testing plan phase 2
```

```sh
based on @documentation/unit-testing-plan.md
implement unit testing plan phase 3
```

**IMPLEMENT LINT**
```sh
implement eslint for coding style and code quality
```

Muncul warning ketika menjalan lint
```sh
find the reason that causing this warning:
(node:62646) ESLintIgnoreWarning: The ".eslintignore" file is no longer supported. Switch to using the "ignores" property in "eslint.config.js": https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/migration-guide#ignoring-files
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```

npm run lint:fix tidak memperbaiki code secara otomasi
```sh
npm run lint:fix do not auto-fixing the code, what is causing that
```

Beberapa error dan warning tidak dapat di-fixing otomatis, perlu dilakukan manual edit
```sh
It cannot auto-fix:
- ❌ Unused variables - Requires manual decision (remove/rename with _ prefix)
- ❌ Console statements - Requires manual review to keep/remove
- ❌ Logic errors - Need human judgment
```

Untuk error sudah di-fix secara manual, tetapi untuk warning akan di-compressed
```sh
could you help me to compress no-console on lints
```

**IMPLEMENT GITHUB ACTIONS**
```sh
Do not code yet
Make a plan to implement github actions to:
do a job to run lint when branch is push or pr to main branch
do a job to run unit test when branch is push or pr to main branch
```

setelah claude memberikan plan github actions, perintahkan claude untuk mengeksekusi plan
```sh
proceed the plan
```

saya mengubah hasil dari claude ai agar pipeline hanya jalan jika push dan pr ke main branch saja
sebelum:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ['*']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

sesudah:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

Setelah saya push ke main branch, pipeline lint dan test jalan bersamaan,
pipeline lint berhasil dijalankan dan pass, tetapi pipeline test failed

```sh
do not code yet, please check this error occured on github actions
  ● Test suite failed to run

    thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 10000 ms for a hook.
    Add a timeout value to this test to increase the timeout, if this is a long-running test. See https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout."

      44 |
      45 | // Global test cleanup
    > 46 | afterAll(async () => {
         | ^
      47 |   if (database.db) {
      48 |     await database.close();
      49 |   }

      at Object.afterAll (tests/setup.js:46:1)

maybe we need to mock the database
```

claude ai memberikan 4 opsi:
Option 1: Add explicit timeout and force close (Quick fix)
Option 2: Mock the database (as you suggested)
Option 3: Fix the underlying database close issue
Option 4: Use a file-based database for CI
saya pilih opsi 1
```sh
proceed option 2
```

Masih muncul error, minta bantuan AI untuk memperbaiki hasil test
```sh
Run test, then fix the issue causing failed testing
```

Hasil perbaikan sudah berhasil, namun terdapat error pada lint yang harus diperbaiki secara manual
